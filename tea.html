            and your style of sipping. Here is a simple little
            guide to get you to start stipping.<br>

            the <a href="tunes.html" class="pop">Tunes</a></p>
            
           
                <h2>Black Tea</h2>
    <p>Black teas are fully oxidized teas.They brew a liquor from 
    reddish brown to dark brown.  They are the most popular type of tea
    in the western world.  Black teas range from 40-60 milligrams of
    caffine per 8 oz cup.  Black teas from China are divided into
    two main categories: Northern Chinese and Southern Chinese.  There
    are three major tea producing areas in India: Darjelling, Assam, and
    Nilgiri.</p>
        
                <h2>Oolong Tea</h2>
    <p>These teas are semi-oxidized, whcih places them midway between
    green and black teas.  This gives them the body and complexity of a 
    black tea, with the brightness and freshness of a green tea.  The
    caffeine content and antioxidant level is also midway between
    that of green and black teas, making them most healthy and palatable.
    A very favortie and desired tea amongst Connoisseurs, all oonlongs
    hail fro meither China or Taiwan.</p>
    
                <h2>Green Tea</h2>
    <p>Green tea leaves plucked in the morning are ready to be brewed
    in a pot the same night.  They bypass of oxidation allows green
    tea to retian most of its natural dark green color, Tannins, 
    Vitamin C, Chlorophyll and minerals.  The taste of green tea is
    therefore more astringent and subtler than oolong or black tea. Green
    tea is the perfect meditative aid: it acts as a mild stimulant,
    without causing insomnia or nervousness.  It refreshes and quiets.</p>
    
                <h2>White Tea</h2>
    <p>White teas are the least processed of all teas.  They release
    the least amount of caffeine of all teas.  Almost all white teas
    hail from Fujian Province, China.  White teas are picked when young
    tea buds are tightly enclosed in new leaves.  This retains a silky,
    downy quality in the leaves.  When you first drink white tea, it
    seems quite tastless - as if you were drinking hot water.  However,
    after a while, you'll become aware of a subtle change in your
    breath and at the back of your mouth.  You will taste a soft,
    nourishing sweetness and eventually experience a similar
    sensation down your throat.</p>
    
            <h2>Pu'erh</h2>
    <p>Pu'erh teas are aged and fermented.  These aged teas are revered
    throughout Asia for their medicinal benefits, which range from
    curing hangovers to reducing cholesterol.  Pu'erh tea is very 
    smooth in taste, and can be even darker than black tea.  This is a
    naturally permented tea, and, if stored properly, the older the tea,
    the better the flavor.</p>
    
            <h2>Yerba Mate (Pronounced "YERBA MAHTAY)</h2>
    <p>Mate is a medicinal and cultural drink of ancient origins.  Introduced
    to the world by the Guarani Indians of South America, Mate is a 
    species of Holly Plant, and can range in flavor from earlthy and roasted
    to grassy.  It is a healthy and stimulating drink, an appetite
    suppressant and also high in Vitamin C, potassium and magnesium.
    The compounds in the plant have a relaxing effect on smooth 
    muscle tissue, rather than a stimulating effect on the central
    nervous system.</p>
    
                <h2>Rooibos</h2>
    <p>Rooibos is a naturally caffeine-free herbal tea indigenous to
    the Cedarburg Mountain area in South Africa, also known as Red Bush
    Tea.  It's naturally sweet flavor, lack of bitter tannins, and naturally
    decaf nature maket it a great tea for the whole family.</p>
