            <p class="titlepara">All that talk about coffee and tea.
            Don't you want to go get some?  You can take your beloved
            out for a sip or surprise them with their favorite flavor.
            This is were a little bit of sweet comes in. I also threw in
            a couple of sweet shops too.

            <h2>BROOKLYNITE COFFE SHOPS</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynroasting.com" class="pop">Brooklyn
    Roasting Company</a> keeps getting bigger and bigger, literally. 
    They've taken over the warehouse at 25 Jay Street in DUMBO. The space is now
    home to their commercial coffee roasters and grinders, a coffee counter where
    you can order their fair trade, organic brews, and plenty of seating space. Grab a spot on one
    of the big orange couches or perch yourself at one of the tables made from
    wood they salvaged during the renovations. This is a great place to hang out for hours.
    </p>
    
        <p><a href="http://milkandrosesbk.com/" class="pop"> Milk &amp; Roses</a> 
      has such a lovely atmosphere When you cross the threshold, it feels like
      you might be entering someone's private library. The walls are full of
      hardbound books, a piano sits on the side of the room and inviting couches
      and tables and chairs are positioned throughout. There's a charming garden
      in the back. In the evening, Milk & Roses serves wine and delicious Italian
      food (the owners are Italian). They often host poetry readings and other
      events.</p>
      
       <p><a href="http://www.cousinjohnsbakery.com/" class="pop"> 
       Cousin John's Cafe &amp; Bakery</a> is my personal favorite.  Although
       it's not a typical coffee shop it represents where the little bit of
       sweet comes in.  They're cakes are the best in Brooklyn.  Perfect for 
       a summer time stroll and chill.  Check it out.</p>
