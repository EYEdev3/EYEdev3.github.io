    <h2>I SIMPLY LOVE COFFE AND TEA</h2>
    <p>This is all about Project Code and my personal project.  It took me 
    a long time to figure out what I wanted the site to be about.  Every time
    I thought I was sure I would change my mind.</p>
    
    <p>That's when I decided to create a short and simple guide about coffee and
    tea.  So here you have it.  It very simple guide that talks about coffe and tea.
    The title mentions sweets because I throw a couple of bakeries in the mix.
    I mean who doesn't love a piece of cake or a cookie with their tea?</p>
    
    <p>If you want to know a bit about the different styles of coffee check out 
    the <a href="coffee.html" class="pop">Coffee</a> Page.  You get 10 points if
    you find a new way to order your coffee.</p>
    
    <p>If tea is more your speed head on over to<a href="tea.html" class="pop">Tea</a> 
    and learn about a new type of tea to expand your pallette.  You never know.  
    You just might shut your mom up when she see's you know your tea.</p>
    
    <p>Take yourself for a stroll and head over to some of coffee and tea spots in
    Brooklyn.  If you can't get there some have coffee or tea that you can order
    online.  Take a look at the <a href="getit.html" class="pop">Get It</a>
    page.</p>
    
    <p>Coffee and tea can be a great experience when you add some music into
    the mix.  Check out the <a href="tunes.html" class="pop">Tunes</a> 
    section and get your sip on.</p>
    
    <p>ENJOY!!!</p>
